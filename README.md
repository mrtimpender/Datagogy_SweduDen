Deployed Link: [DataGogy MVP](https://datagogy.herokuapp.com/)  

This project is an MVP that was created for Denver Startup Weekend Education at Denver University. It's a 54 hour start-up hackathon where educators, business professionals, and developers conceptualize and build viable products, services, and school models that solve educationâ€™s most pressing problems. The team consisted of one other developer, a business specialist with a PhD in physics, and a teacher who is an aspiring Data Scientist. The idea was to create an app that can build and rate quizzes/questions and give the teacher visual data that analyzes their effectiveness as well as portrays student growth.
